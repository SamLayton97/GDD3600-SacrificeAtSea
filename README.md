# GDD3600-SacrificeAtSea

Pilot a creaky submarine in its descent through a minefield as you search of treasure. Pay attention to malfunctions in the vessel’s hardware as they hinder your navigational capabilities. There isn’t enough time to fix everything. Some parts must remain broken to repair others. Will you learn to balance helmsmanship with repairs as pressure builds or will indecision become your undersea tomb?
